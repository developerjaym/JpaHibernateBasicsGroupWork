# Jpa and Hibernate Practice

There are 5 projects in here, each in a separate package.

Everyone should keep in mind the following
1. There is a **shared** package with some user input stuff and other stuff.
2. Use OOP.
3. Create a github repo, and make your group partners admins.
4. Group partner with name earlier in alphabet, codes first.
5. Create entities.
6. Agree on when to take lunch break and agree on when to come back.
7. Next person alphabetically will code
8. Work on implementing your repository.
9. Next student codes.
10. Put everything together:
    * Think of "use cases" and making each a method in a service class.
    * Fill in those methods, one at a time.
    * Test each use case manually
    * Simplify
